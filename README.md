120 - Stacks of Flapjacks

Input
The input consists of a sequence of stacks of pancakes. Each stack will consist of between 1 and 30
pancakes and each pancake will have an integer diameter between 1 and 100. The input is terminated
by end-of-file. Each stack is given as a single line of input with the top pancake on a stack appearing
first on a line, the bottom pancake appearing last, and all pancakes separated by a space.
Output
For each stack of pancakes, the output should echo the original stack on one line, followed by some
sequence of flips that results in the stack of pancakes being sorted so that the largest diameter pancake
is on the bottom and the smallest on top. For each stack the sequence of flips should be terminated by
a ‘0’ (indicating no more flips necessary). Once a stack is sorted, no more flips should be made.
